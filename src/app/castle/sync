make local changes

1) service x calls create method
2) crdt messages for action get created
3) crdt messages are stored in messages_crdt with needs_sync = true
4) crdt messages are processed and applied to local database, clock/merkle are updated
5) next sync cycle reads messages from messages_crdt with needs_sync = true
6) calls sync worker, pushes messages, retrieves new upstream messages


get upstream changes
1) call sync worker, retrieve new upstream messages
2) store them in messages_crdt with needs_sync = false
3) filter incoming messages for relevance (i.e. no newer version exists locally)
4) apply all relevant messages locally, clock/merkle are updated
5) verify that upstream clock/merkle and local clock/merkle match
